# Exact diagonalization using Laczos method

This is the simple example for using cytnx with ED to calculate 1D Transverse field ising model:

H = -[s]SzSz - (1-[s])Sx 


# Cytnx library:
    
[Cytnx](https://github.com/kaihsin/Cytnx)

# Results:
    The (2nd) energy gap with different system size L that shows the avoid level crossing:
